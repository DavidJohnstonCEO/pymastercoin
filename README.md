Python Mastercoin Tools


Work in progress for a python mastercoin client which works connecting to a running bitcoin client. 
Works like the Mastercoin Advisor script, only that it can also automatically create and broadcast the actual transactions. (no need to create them manually). 

The plan is to build this as a base to test new methods for storing the data payload in the bitcoin blockchain.
